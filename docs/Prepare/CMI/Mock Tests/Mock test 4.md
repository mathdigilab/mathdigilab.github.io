## Part A: Short-answer type questions

**For this part, answers must be written without any explanation.**


<ol>

<li>
<p>
Let \(n\) be a positive integer. Line segments can be drawn parallel to edges of a given
rectangle. What is the minimum number of line segments that are required so as to divide
the rectangle into exactly \(n\) subrectangles? The subrectangles need not be of the same dimension.
</p>

<p>
For example, in order to get 5 subrectangles we need 3 line segments.

<li>

<li>
Let \(X\) be a set and \(A, B, C\) be its subsets. Which of the following is necessarily true?<br>

(a) \(A-(A-B)=B\)<br>
(b) \(A-(B \cup C)=(A-B) \cup(A-C)\)<br>
(c) \(A-(B \cap C)=(A-B) \cap(A-C)\)<br>
(d) \(B-(A-B)=B\)<br>

</li>

<!--
Solution: (D) Note that $A-B=A \cap B^{\prime}$. Also, $(A-B)^{\prime}=\left(A \cap B^{\prime}\right)^{\prime}=A^{\prime} \cup B$.
Hence $B-(A-B)=B \cap(A-B)^{\prime}=B \cap\left(A^{\prime} \cup B\right)=\left(B \cap A^{\prime}\right) \cup B=B$.

<li> Find the number of functions \(f:\{1,\ldots, 5\} \to \{1,\ldots, 5\}\) such that \(f(f(x))=x\) .</li>

<p>
<li>
The number of roots of \(g(x)=5 x^{4}-4 x+1=0\) in \([0,1]\) is<br>

(a) 0<br>
(b) 1<br>
(c) 2<br>
(d) 3<br>

</li>

<!--
\(g(0)>0\) and \(g(1)>0\) while \(g(1 / 2)<0 .\) Hence, \(g(x)=0\) has at least two roots. Note that \(g^{\prime}(x)<0\) if \(x^{3}<1 / 5\) and \(g^{\prime}(x)>0\) if \(x^{3}>1 / 5\). Hence, the function is decreasing in \((-\infty, \sqrt[3]{1 / 5})\) and increasing on \((\sqrt[3]{1 / 5}, \infty)\). At \(\sqrt[3]{1 / 5}\) the function has absolute minimum.

**Clearly explain your entire reasoning.** No credit will be given without reasoning. Partial solutions may get partial credit.



<p>
<b>B1.</b> Find all real \(x\) for which the equation holds:

\[ 4^{x}+9^{x}+36^{x}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}-2 x^{2}}=1 \]

</p>


<!--

Solution. To start with, note that we must have \(\frac{1}{2}-2 x^{2} \geq 0\), and therefore \(x^{2} \leq \frac{1}{4}\), i.e., \(-\frac{1}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{1}{2}\).
Now if \(x \geq 0\), then \(a^{x} \geq 1\) for any \(a>1\), hence \(4^{x}+9^{x}+36^{x}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}-2 x^{2}}>1\). So the given equation has no solution with \(0 \leq x\).
Next, note that \(4^{-1 / 2}+9^{-1 / 2}+36^{-1 / 2}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{6}=1\), and that \(\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}-2 x^{2}}=0\) when \(x=-\frac{1}{2}\). This
means that \(x=-\frac{1}{2}\) solves the given equation. So \(x=-\frac{1}{2}\) is a solution of the equation. Finally, suppose that \(-\frac{1}{2}<x<0\). Then \(4^{x}+9^{x}+36^{x}>\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{6}\), i.e., \(4^{x}+9^{x}+36^{x}>1\), and therefore \(4^{x}+9^{x}+36^{x}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}-2 x^{2}}>1\). So the given equation has no solution with \(-\frac{1}{2}<x<0\).
It follows that the only solution to the given equation is \(x=-\frac{1}{2}\).

exactly once. Show that we will return to \(X_1\) at the end of the journey. \(\;\;\) [2 marks]<br>


(b) Stating from the island \(X_1\), how many ways one can cross the \(2n\) bridges so
that each bridge is crossed exactly once? \(\;\;\) [8 marks]

<p>
<b>B3.</b> Consider the sequence of natural numbers \(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\) defined
as follows:<br>

<ul>
<li>\(a_1=2\).</li>
<li>For each positive number \(n\), \(a_{n+1} = a_n + \) product of the prime factors of \(a_n\).</li>
</ul>

The first eight numbers of the sequence are: \( 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 \text{ and } 60 \).
<br>

(a) Does the number 210 appear in the sequence? \(\;\;\) [1 mark]<br>
(b) Prove that the product of the first 2021 primes appears in the sequence. \(\;\;\) [9 marks]

<b>B4.</b> \(A B C\) is an acute triangle with \(B C=4\) and \(A C=5\).
Let \(D\) be the midpoint of \(BC\). \(BE\) is the altitude  to \(AC\).
\(CF\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle B C A\). If \(A D, B E\), and \(C F\) meet at a single point,

By the Angle Bisector Theorem, \(\frac{B F}{A F}=\frac{4}{5}\).
Then by Ceva's theorem we see that \(\frac{C E}{A E}=\frac{4}{5}\), so \(C E=\frac{20}{9}\) and \(A E=\frac{25}{9}\).
By the Pythagorean theorem, \(B E=\frac{8 \sqrt{14}}{0}\).
