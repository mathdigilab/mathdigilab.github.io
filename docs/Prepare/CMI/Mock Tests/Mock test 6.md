## Part A: Short-answer type questions

**For this part, answers must be written without any explanation.**




<ol>






<p>
<li>
\(ABCD\) is a unit square and \(P\) is the midpoint of segment \(OB\) in the figure below. What
is the length of \(AP\)?

</p>

</li>
</p>


<li>
Suppose \(2 \log x+\log y=x-y\). Then the equation of the tangent line to the graph of this equation at the point \((1,1)\) is:<br>
(a) \(x+2 y=3\)<br>
(b) \(x-2 y=3\)<br>
(c) \(2 x+y=3\)<br>
(d) \(2 x-y=3\)
</li>

<li>
<p>
How many triples \(({A}, {B}, {C})\) are there of sets with union \({A} \cup {B} \cup {C}=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}\) and \({A} \cap {B} \cap {C}=\varnothing ?\)
</p>


</li>

<p>
<li>Find all integers \(x\) for which \( |x^3+2x| \) is prime.</li>
</p>


<li>
<p>
Given that \(a_{1}=2, a_{2}=3, a_{n}=a_{n-1}+2 a_{n-2}\), what is \(a_{19}+a_{20}\)?
</p>
</li>



<li>
<p>
A spirograph is a toy that has a cog and a rack. The cog and the rack have teeth that fit together. In the figure shown below,
the cog has 12 teeth and the rack has 30.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="/assets/images/mt11_spiro.png"/>
</p>

<p>The cog has a hole near its circumference. If we put a pen in the hole and turn the cog around
the rack many times, we get a pattern. In the example shown above, we get a pattern with five pointed ends. Pointed ends are those
points in the pattern where the pen is closest to the rack.</p>

<p>Suppose the cog had 9 teeth and the rack had 20. How may pointed ends would the pattern have?</p>

</li>


<p>
<li>
\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow 0}\left(\frac{\sin x}{x}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\cos x}} \]
</li>
</p>


<p>
<li>
How many positive integers divide at least one of \(10^{30}\) and \(20^{30}\) ?<br>
</li>
</p>


<li>
<p>

Suppose that the set \(\{1,2, \cdots, 2022\}\) has been partitioned into disjoint pairs \(\left\{a_{i}, b_{i}\right\}(1 \leq i \leq 1011)\)
so that for all \(i,\left|a_{i}-b_{i}\right|\) equals 1 or 6. Find all the possible values for the last digit of the sum:

\[ \left|a_{1}-b_{1}\right|+\left|a_{2}-b_{2}\right|+\cdots+\left|a_{1011}-b_{1011}\right| \]
</p>




</li>


<li>
<p>
There is a highway on which a group of police officers are testing for drunk-driving.
They have breathalyzers that raises a false alarm in 5% of the cases in which the driver is sober. That is, even if the driver is not drunk there
is a 5% chance that the breathalyzer incorrectly shows him to be drunk.  However, the breathalyzer never fails to detect a truly drunk person.
We know for a fact that one in a every thousand drivers on the highway is driving drunk.
Suppose the police officers stop a driver at random to administer a breathalyzer test. It indicates that the driver is drunk.
The probability that he is truly drunk is around: <br>

(a) 2%<br>
(b) 10%<br>
(c) 20%<br>
(d) 95%


</p>
</li>

## Part B: Subjective questions

**Clearly explain your entire reasoning.** No credit will be given without reasoning. Partial solutions may get partial credit.


<p>
<b>B1. </b> Prove or disprove: There are two numbers \(x, y\) such that:

\begin{align*}
x+y&=1\\
x^{2}+y^{2}&=2\\
x^{3}+y^{3}&=3
\end{align*}

</p>

<p>
<b>B2.</b> In the figure shown below, \(ABCD\) is a square with side length of \(4\) cm. \(DQ=BP=1\) cm. Line segments \(AQ\)
and \(DP\) intersect at point \(X\). Find the area of the triangle \(PQX\).<br>

<p style="text-align:center">

</p>

<p>
<b>B3.</b> (a) Suppose we have a polynomial \(p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0\) where \(a_i\)s are real numbers. If \( \sum \frac{a_i}{i+1} = 0 \), prove that \(p(x)\) has a real root between 0 and 1. \(\;\;\;\) [4 marks]<br>
(b) Evaluate the following integral:
\[ \int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{x \sin x}{1+\cos ^{2} x} d x \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;  \text{[6 marks]} \]
</p>


---


<p>
<b>B4.</b> Determine all polynomials \(f(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c\) such that
\(f(a)=a, f(b)=b\) and \(f(c)=c\).
</p>


---


<p>
<b>B5.</b> A special matrix is a square matrix whose entries are \(0\) or \(1\) such that, in each row, the \(1\)s appear as consecutive entries.
For example, the following is a \(4 \times 4\) special matrix.

\[
\left[\begin{array}{llll}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1
\end{array}\right]
\]

Show that the determinant of any special matrix is either \(1,-1\) or \(0\).
</p>

<p>
<b>B6.</b> Show that the number \(4^{2020}\) cannot be written as a sum of three cubes. In other words,
prove that there are no integers \(a_1,a_2\) and \(a_3\) such that
\[  a_1^3 + a_2^3 + a_3^3 = 4^{2020} \]
</p>
