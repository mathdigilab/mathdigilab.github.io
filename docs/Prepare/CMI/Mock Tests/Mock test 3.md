## Part A: Short-answer type questions

**For this part, answers must be written without any explanation.**


<ol>

<li>
<p>
Find all possible triplets \( (x,y,z) \) satisfying the equations:

\begin{align*}

\end{align*}
</p>
</li>



<li>
<p>
There is a glass cylinder with radius \(R\). An ant is \(d\) cm from the mouth of the cylinder. It is
on the <i>outer surface</i> of the cylinder. There is a honey drop on the <i>inner surface</i> of cylinder
that is also \(d\) cm from the mouth of the cylinder and diametrically opposite to the ant. What is the shortest distance the ant has to travel
to get to the honey drop?

<ol>
<li>a bijection.</li>
<li>one-one but not onto.</li>
<li>onto but not one-one.</li>

probability that 3 is the closest number to \(y/x\)?</li>

\int_{2.5}^{3.5} 1/2z^2 dz = 2/35. Or use the square and triangle method.

<li> Which of the following functions are bijections?

<ol>
<li> \(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \)  defined as \( f(x):=x+\tan^{-1}x \).</li>
<li> \(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \)  defined as \( f(x):=x-\tan^{-1}x \).</li>

<li>
<p>An ATM machine dispenses one note at a time. We can collect either a Rs. 100, Rs. 200 or Rs. 500 note in one operation.
We can collect a certain sum in multiple ways. For example, there are three different ways to collect
a sum of Rs. 300: 100+200, 200+100 or 100+100+100. What is the minimum sum that we can collect in at least 30 different ways?

<li>

Let \(f\) be a twice differentiable function on \(\mathbb{R}\).
Also \(f^{\prime \prime}(x)>0\) for all \(x \in \mathbb{R}\).

Which of the following statements is true?

<ol>
<li> \(f(x)=0\) has exactly two solutions on \(\mathbb{R}\).</li>
<li> \(f(x)=0\) has a positive solution if   \(f(0)=0\) and \(f^{\prime}(0)=0\).</li>
<li> \(f(x)=0\) has no positive solution if  \(f(0)=0\) and \(f^{\prime}(0)>0\).</li>
<li> \(f(x)=0\) has no positive solution if  \(f(0)=0\) and \(f^{\prime}(0)<0\).</li>

</ol>



<!--
Answer: $\mathbf{C}$ $f^{\prime \prime}(x)>0 \Rightarrow f^{\prime}(x)$ is increasing. Also $f^{\prime}(0)>0 \Rightarrow f^{\prime}(x)>0$ if $x>0 . \Rightarrow f(x)=0$ has
no positive solution.
