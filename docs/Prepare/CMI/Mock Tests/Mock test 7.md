## Part B: Subjective questions

**Clearly explain your entire reasoning.** No credit will be given without reasoning. Partial solutions may get partial credit.



<p>
<b>B1.</b>
Consider the quadratic function \(f(x)=x^{2}+b x+c\) defined on the set of real numbers. Given that the roots of \(f\) are two distinct prime numbers \(p\) and \(q\), and \(f(p-q)=6 p q\), determine the primes \(p\) and \(q\), and the function \(f\).
</p>


<p>
<b>B2.</b> \(AB\) is a diameter of a circle of radius \(10\) units.
\(C\) is a point on the circle such that the length of arc \(B C=\frac{5 \pi}{3}\).
The bisector of \(\angle A C B\) cuts the circle at \(D\). Find the length of \(CD\).

<p>
<b>B3.</b> Determine the number of positive integers \(n\) less than \(10000\) for which the sum
\[
\frac{1}{2 \times\lfloor\sqrt{1}\rfloor+1}+\frac{1}{2 \times\lfloor\sqrt{2}\rfloor+1}+\frac{1}{2 \times\lfloor\sqrt{3}\rfloor+1}+\cdots+\frac{1}{2 \times\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor+1}
\]

is an integer.<br>
<i>Notation.</i> \(\lfloor x\rfloor\) denotes the largest integer that is less than or equal to \(x\).<br><br>
</p>


<p>
<b>B4.</b> We say that a function \(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) is flippy if \(f(f(x))=-x\) for all \(x \in \mathbb{R}\)<br>

(a) Prove or disprove: \(f\) is always injective.\(\;\;\;\) [2 marks]<br>
(b) Give an example of a flippy function.\(\;\;\;\) [3 marks]<br>
(c) Prove that there is no flippy function that is continuous. \(\;\;\;\) [5 marks]

</p>


<p><b>B5.</b> (a) Suppose \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime numbers. Compute the limit:
\[ \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \sqrt{k^{2} q^{2}+2 p k}-\sqrt{k^{2} q^{2}} \;\;\;\;\;\text{[4 marks]}\]

<b>B6.</b> A nonnegative integer \(k\) is <i>special</i> when all pairs of 1s in the binary
representation of \(k\) are separated by at least two zeroes.

How many special numbers are less than \(2^{15}\)?
