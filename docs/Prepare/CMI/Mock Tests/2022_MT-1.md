## Part A: Short-answer type questions

**For this part, answers must be written without any explanation.**



<ol>


<li>
<p>
The values of \(k\) for which the line \(y=k x\) intersects the parabola \(y=(x-1)^{2}\) are
</p>
<p>
(a) \(k \geq-4\).<br>
(b) \(k \leq 0 \).<br>
(c) \(-4 \leq k \leq 0\).<br>
(d) \(k \geq 0\) or \(k \leq-4\).<br>
</p>
</li>


<!--
Answer: d
Equating $k x=(x-1)^{2}$, we get $x^{2}-(k+2) x+1=0$. The discriminant is $(k+2)^{2}-4=k(k+4) \geq 0$ for $k \geq 0$ or $k \leq-4$.
-->

<li>
<p>
Let \(\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=1\), then \(\operatorname{gcd}\left(a+b, a^{2}-a b+b^{2}\right)=\)<br>
(a) 2<br>
(b) 1 or 2<br>
(c) 1 or 3<br>
(d) 2 or 3<br>
</p>
</li>

<li><p>Find the remainder when \(\displaystyle \sum_{r=1}^{50} r! \) is divided by 12.</p></li>



<li>
<p>
Find the number of solutions to the equation \(\sqrt{1-\sin x}=\cos x\) in the interval \([0,5 \pi]\).
</p>
</li>



<!--
Answer: B
Squaring both sides we get $1-\sin x=1-\sin ^{2} x$ and thus $\sin x=0$ or $\sin x=1$. In $[0,5 \pi]$, we then have $x=0, \pi, 2 \pi, 3 \pi, 4 \pi, \pi / 2,5 \pi / 2,7 \pi / 2$. We need to reject the values $\pi, 3 \pi, 5 \pi$ as in these cases LHS $=1$ and RHS $=-1$. Hence number of solutions is 6 .
-->

<li>
<p>
The number of real roots of the equation \(x^6-x+1\) is:
</p>
<p>
(a) Zero.<br>
(b) exactly 1.<br>
(c) exactly 2.<br>
(d) exactly 4.<br>
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
Alice has the five letters: A, B, C, D, E. How many ways can she rearrange the letters into three words? The order of the words matter. For example, "AB C DE" and "C AB DE" are different rearrangements.
</p>
</li>





<li>
<p>
Find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial obtained after expanding and collecting the terms of the product \(\left(5x^{2}-5x+1\right)^{10}\left(x^{4}-2x+1\right)^{20}\).
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>
Let \(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) be a continuous function such that \(|f(x)-f(y)| \geq|x-y|\) for all real numbers \(x, y\). Then which
of the options below are true?<br>
(a) \(f\) is one-one<br>
(b) \(f\) is onto<br>
(c) \(f^{-1}\) may not exist<br>
(d) \(f^{-1}\) is continuous<br>
</p>
</li>

<!--
Ans: (b), (c),(d).
-->







<li>
<p>


Let \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) and \(\left\{b_{n}\right\}\) be two sequences of non-zero real numbers. We say that \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) and \(\left\{b_{n}\right\}\) are <i>mostly equal</i> if \(\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}=1\). Which of the following sequences are mostly equal?<br>

(a) \(a_{n}=n-2\sqrt{n}, b_{n}=n\).<br>
(b) \(a_{n}=n^{2}+\sqrt[3]{n}, b_{n}=n\).<br>
(c) \(a_{n}=n!, b_{n}=n^{n}\).<br>
(d) \(a_{n}=\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^{n}, b_{n}=e\).<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>

<!--Ans: (a),(d).-->



<li>
We have two identical cups denoted by M and W. Cup M contains a milk and cup W has equal amount of water in it. One spoon of milk is 
transferred to cup W and then one spoon of the mixture in cup W is transferred to cup M. Then which of the following is true?<br>
(a) The amount of milk in cup W bigger than the amount of water in cup M.<br>
(b) The amount of milk in cup W smaller than the amount of water in cup M.<br>
(c) The amount of milk in cup W is equal to the amount of water in cup M.<br>
(d) Can't say since it depends on the size of the spoon.<br>

## Part B: Subjective questions

**Clearly explain your entire reasoning.** No credit will be given without reasoning. Partial solutions may get partial credit.

<b>B3.</b> We have three colors: red, blue and green. In how many ways can we color the vertices of an octagon such that no two adjacent vertices have
the same color? A valid coloring of the octagon is shown below. Adjacent vertices are connected by a line segment.</p>

<br><img src="/assets/images/001_22_b3_octagon_coloring.png"/>
</p>


<p><b>Remark.</b> If we were coloring a triangle instead of an octagon, there would be 6 ways to do it. The first vertex can be colored in 3 ways, the second vertex can
be colored 2 ways and the color of the third vertex would be fixed.</p>
