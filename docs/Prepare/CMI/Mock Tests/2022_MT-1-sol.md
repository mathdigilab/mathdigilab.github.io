<li><p>Find the remainder when \(\displaystyle \sum_{r=1}^{50} r! \) is divided by 12.</p></li>

<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>

<li>
<p>
Find the number of solutions to the equation \(\sqrt{1-\sin x}=\cos x\) in the interval \([0,5 \pi]\).
</p>
</li>

<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
Squaring both sides we get \(1-\sin x=1-\sin^{2} x\) and thus \(\sin x=0\) or \(\sin x=1\).
In \([0,5 \pi]\), we then have \(x=0, \pi, 2 \pi, 3 \pi, 4 \pi, \pi / 2,5 \pi / 2,7 \pi / 2\). 
We need to reject the values \(\pi, 3 \pi, 5 \pi\) as in these cases LHS=1 and RHS=-1. Hence number of solutions is 6 .
</details>

<li>
<p>
The number of real roots of the equation \(x^6-x+1\) is:
</p>
<p>
(a) Zero.<br>
(b) exactly 1.<br>
(c) exactly 2.<br>

Alice has the five letters: A, B, C, D, E. How many ways can she rearrange the letters into three words? The order of the words matter. For example, "AB C DE" and "C AB DE" are different rearrangements.
</p>

<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
We can permute the letters is 5! ways. Each permutation can be split is \( {4 \choose 2} \) ways. Hence, the required number of ways is \(120\times 6 = 720\).

(c) \(f^{-1}\) may not exist<br>
(d) \(f^{-1}\) is continuous<br>
</p>
</li>

<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
(a),(b) and (d). If \(f(x)=f(y)\), then \(|f(x)-f(y)|=0\) so \(f\) is one-one. If \(f(1)> f(0)\) the function is monotonically increasing. If \(f(1)< f(0)\), then the function is monotonically decreasing.

## Part B: Subjective questions

**Clearly explain your entire reasoning.** No credit will be given without reasoning. Partial solutions may get partial credit.

<p><b>B1 (a)</b> Find a four digit number which on division by 149 leaves a remainder of 17 and on division by 148 leaves a remainder of 29 .
</p>




<p><b>B1 (b)</b> Find all the primes \(p\)  such that \(2^p+p^2\) is also prime.
</p>



<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>

<p>
(a) Let \(x\) represent the required four digit number. Thus \(x=149 q_{1}+17\) and \(x=148 q_{2}+29\).
Since \(x\) is a four digit number \(7 \leqslant q_{1}, q_{2}<70\).
Subtracting the above equations gives

\begin{align*}
149 q_{1}-148 q_{2}&=12\\
148\left(q_{1}-q_{2}\right)+q_{1}&=12
\end{align*}

Hence, since \(q_{1}-q_{2}\) is an integer its value must be zero, which gives
\(q_{1}=q_{2}=12\), and \(x=149 \times 12+17=1805\).
</p>

<p>
(b) Note if \(p>3\), then \(p \equiv 1\) or \(5 \bmod 6\). Then \(p^{2} \equiv 1 \bmod 3\). As \(p\) is odd, \(2^{p} \equiv 2\) \(\bmod 3\), so \(p^{2}+2^{p}\) is divisible by 3 and thus not prime. Thus we only need to check the cases when \(p=2\) and \(p=3\), and we see that \(p^{2}+2^{p}\) is only prime when \(p=3\left(p^{2}+2^{p}=17\right)\).

<b>B2.</b>  
Three points \(A, B\) and \(C\) lie inside a circle whose radius is 1 cm. Show that \(B C^{2}+C A^{2}+A B^{2}\) is less than or equal to 9 sq. cm.
</p>





<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>

<p>
We may assume that points \(A, B\) and \(C\) lie on a circle and form a triangle. Further, we may restrict our triangles to those where \(BC=AC\).
The reason is given below.<br>
</p>

<p>
<i>Claim:</i> The expression \(BC^2+CA^2+AB^2\) has a maximum when \(BC=AC\).<br>
<i>Proof:</i><br>
Pick a point \(C^\prime\) such that \(AC^\prime = BC^\prime\). We will show that triangle \(ABC^\prime\) is a better choice than triangle \(ABC\).

Consider the figure shown below.
\begin{align*}
&A B^{2}=A C^{2}+B C^{2}-2 A C \cdot B C \cos \theta=A C^{\prime}{ }^{2}+B C^{t^{2}}-2 A C^{\prime} B C^{\prime} \cos \theta\\
&\text { Since } \quad \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{AC} \cdot \mathrm{BC}=\frac{\text { Area } \triangle \mathrm{ABC}}{\sin \theta} < \frac{\text { Area } \triangle AB\mathrm{C}^{\prime}}{\sin \theta}=\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{AC}^{\prime} \cdot \mathrm{BC}^{\prime}\\
&\text { we have } A B^{2}+A C^{2}+B C^{2}=2 A B^{2}+2 A C \cdot B C \cdot \cos \theta\\
&< 2 A B^{2}+2 A C^{\prime} \cdot B C^{\prime} \cos \theta=A B^{2}+A C^{\prime 2}+B C^{\prime 2} \; \square
\end{align*}
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<br><img src="/assets/images/mt13_circumcircle.jpg"/>
</p>

Similar argument can made to show that \(AB=BC\) at the maximum value. Hence, the quantity \(AB^2+BC^2+CA^2\) is maximized when the triangle \(ABC\) is equilateral. When
this happens each side has length \(2\cos 30^\circ=\sqrt{3}\) cm. The statement follows.

<b>B3.</b> We have three colors: red, blue and green. In how many ways can we color the vertices of an octagon such that no two adjacent vertices have
the same color? A valid coloring of the octagon is shown below. Adjacent vertices are connected by a line segment.</p>


<p style="text-align:center">
<br><img src="/assets/images/001_22_b3_octagon_coloring.png"/>
</p>


<p><b>Remark.</b> If we were coloring a triangle instead of an octagon, there would be 6 ways to do it. The first vertex can be colored in 3 ways, the second vertex can
be colored 2 ways and the color of the third vertex would be fixed.</p>



<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
For any \(n\)-polygon with four or more sides, we consider two cases.<br>
<i>Case 1:</i> Vertex 1 and vertex \(n-1\) are different colours. Then this means that vertices 1 to \(n-1\) can be coloured in all ways possible for a \(n-1\) gon and the colour of vertex \(n\) is fixed. <br>
<i>Case 2:</i> Vertex 1 and vertex \(n-1\) are the same colour. Then vertices 1 to \(n-2\) can be coloured in all ways possible for a \(n-2\) gon, and then there are 2 ways to colour vertex \(n\).
We define \(a_{n}\) as the legal colourings of an \(n\)-gon. Then \(a_{n}\) can be recursively defined as
\[ a_{n}=a_{n-1}+2 a_{n-2} \]
An edge or a triangle can be colored in 6 ways, so \(a_2=a_3=6\). Therefore, for \(n=8, a_{n}=258\).

<b>B4 (a).</b> Simplify \( \sqrt[3]{2+\sqrt{5}} + \sqrt[3]{2-\sqrt{5}}\).
</p>


<p>
<b>B4 (b).</b> Which is larger: \(\sqrt[8]{8!}\) or \( \sqrt[9]{9!} \)?
</p>


<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
(a) Let \(x= \sqrt[3]{2+\sqrt{5}} + \sqrt[3]{2-\sqrt{5}}\). Let \(A\) and \(B\) be the two summands, so \(x=A+B\).

Using the identity \((A+B)^3 = A^3 + B^3 + 3AB(A+B)\), we get:

\begin{align*}
x^{3} &=(2+\sqrt{5})+3(\sqrt[3]{2+\sqrt{5}} \cdot 3 \sqrt[3]{2-\sqrt{5}})(x)+(2-\sqrt{5}) \\
&=4+3 \sqrt[3]{(-1)} x \\
&=4-3 x
\end{align*}

Hence, \(x^3+3x-4=(x-1)(x^2+x+4)=0\). The only real solution to the equation is \(x=1\).

<br>
(b) We that that \(8! < 9^8\). Multiply both sides of the inequality with \(8!^8\). We get:

\[ (8!)^9 < 9^8\cdot(8!)^8 = (9!)^8 \]


Take the 72 and root of both sides
\begin{align*}
&(8 !)^{9 / 72}<(9 !)^{8 / 72} \\
&\text { 1.e. }  \sqrt[8]{8} !< \sqrt[9]{9} !
\end{align*}

<b>B5.</b>
<ol type="I">
<li> Suppose \(f\) is a differentiable function from the \(\mathbb{R}\) into \(\mathbb{R}\). Suppose \(f'(x) > f(x)\) for all \(x \in \mathbb{R}\) , and \(f(x_0) = 0\) for some \(x_0 \in \mathbb{R}\). Prove that \(f(x) > 0\) for all \(x > x_0\) .</li>
<li> Show that the equation \(Ae^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2}\) , where \(A\) is a positive constant, has exactly one real root.</li>

(i)  Let \(g(x) = e^{-x} f(x)\) . Then, \(g'(x) =e^{-x} (f'(x) — f(x)) > 0\) . As \(g\) is an increasing function, so we have \(g(x)= e^{-x} f(x) \geqslant 0\) for \(x >x_0\) , and the conclusion follows.
<br>
<br>
(ii) Let \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) be defined by \(f(x) = Ae^x - 1 - x - \dfrac{x^2}{2}\).<br><br>

Now, \(f(x) \to -\infty\) as \(x \to -\infty\) , and \(f(x) \to +\infty\) as \(x \to +\infty\) . Hence, as \(f\) is continuous, it has at least one real root, say \(x_0\). Observe that : $$f'(x) = Ae^x - 1 - x > Ae^x - 1 - x - \frac{x^2}{2} = f(x)\qquad\forall~ x\in\mathbb{R}$$

Thus, by part (i), we deduce that \(f\) has only one real root, viz. \(x_0\).

From MT7 last time. SMT. Ans = 10\sqrt{2}. Use similar triangles.

<details open><summary>Sol. </summary>

<b>Ans.</b>  \(10\sqrt{2}\). <br>

The key is to observe that \( \Delta BEC \sim \Delta DEA \). Likewise, \(\Delta AFB \sim \Delta CFD \).<br>


<b>Lemma 1.</b> \(\triangle BEC \sim \Delta DEA \) <br>

<p>
<i>Proof: </i> Since \(ABCD\) is a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum to \(\pi\).
Let \(\angle EBC=\theta\). Hence, \( \angle ADC = \pi-\theta\), so \(\angle EDA = \theta \).
</p>

<br>

<b>Lemma 2.</b> \(AE=4\) cm and \(DE=5\) cm.<br>


<p><i>Proof: </i>

Since \(DA:BC=1:2\) the scaling factor between similar triangles \(\Delta BEC\) and \(\Delta DEA\) is 2.


Let \(AE=p\) and \(DE=q\). Then we have:

\begin{align*}
AB&=BE-AE\\
   &=2DE-AE\\
   &=2q-p
\end{align*}

Also, \(CD=2p-q\). So we have:

\begin{align*}
2q-p &= 6 \\
2p-q &= 3
\end{align*}

Solving for \(p\) and \(q\), we get \(p=4\) and \(q=5\). \(\;\;\;\square\)

</p>


Similarly we have \(FC=8\) cm and \(FD=10\) cm. <br>

Let \(\angle B=\theta\). Then \(\angle F D E=\pi-\theta\). Apply the Law of Cosines to \(\triangle E B F\) to get:


\[ E F^{2}=B E^{2}+B F^{2}-2 B E \cdot B F \cdot \cos \theta=10^{2}+20^{2}-2 \cdot 10 \cdot 20 \cos \theta=500-400 \cos \theta \]

and to \( \triangle E D F\) to get

\[ E F^{2}=D E^{2}+D F^{2}-2 \cdot D E \cdot D F \cos (\pi-\theta)=5^{2}+10^{2}-2 \cdot 5 \cdot 10 \cos \theta=125+100 \cos \theta  \]

Solving for \(E F^{2}\), we get \(E F^{2}=200\). So \(EF=10\sqrt{2}\).
