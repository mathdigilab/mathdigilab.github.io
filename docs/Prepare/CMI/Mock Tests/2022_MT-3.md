<!--
Raghav B6.
Answer is 50.
If \(f(x)=n x, g(x)=e^{2 x}\) and \(h(x)=g(f(x))\), then \(h(x)=e^{2(n x)}\). The derivative of \(h(x)\) is \(2 n \cdot e^{2 n x}\), by the chain rule. Then, plugging in 0 for \(x\) gets us \(2 n=100\), so \(n=50\).

<p><b>B4.</b>
Three squares have average area \(\bar{A}=100 \mathrm{~m}^{2}\). The average of the lengths of their sides is \(\bar{l}=10 \mathrm{~m}\). Find all possible values of
the size of the largest of the three squares. The answer must be given along with reasoning.
</p>


<!--
Solution. Let $x$ be the length of the side of a square, and let the probability of $x$ be $1 / 3,1 / 3,1 / 3$ over the three lengths $l_{1}, l_{2}, l_{3}$. Then the information that we have is that $\mathcal{E}[x]=10$ and $\mathcal{E}[f(x)]=100$, where $f(x)=x^{2}$ is the function mapping lengths to areas. This is a strictly convex $\sim$ function. We notice that the equality $\mathcal{E}[f(x)]=f(\mathcal{E}[x])$ holds, therefore $x$ is a constant, and the three lengths must all be equal. The area of the largest square is $100 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$.

<p><b>B5.</b> Let \(t\) be a randomly chosen positive divisor of 20!. What is the probability that \(t\) can be written as \(a^{2}+b^{2}\) for some integers \(a\) and \(b\)?
</p>


<!--
SMT 2021 and 2011 below
Answer: $\frac{5}{54}$
Solution: The choice $k$ can be written as the sum of two squares if and only if every prime $p \equiv 3(\bmod 4)$ appears to an even power in the prime factorization of $k$. The primes $p \leq 20$ with $p \equiv 3(\bmod 4)$ are $3,7,11$, and 19. Also, $20 !=3^{8} \cdot 7^{2} \cdot 11^{1} \cdot 19^{1} \cdot k$ where $k$ is not divisible by any of these primes. Therefore, a randomly positive divisor of 20 ! has prime factorization $3^{a} \cdot 7^{b} \cdot 11^{c} \cdot 19^{d} \cdot l$ where $l$ is not divisible by any of these primes, $a \in[0,8], a \in[0,2], a \in[0,1]$, $a \in[0,1]$. Furthermore $a, b, c$, and $d$ take on the possible values with equally likelihood and independently of each other. It suffices to compute the probability that $a, b, c$, and $d$ are all even which is $\left(\frac{5}{9}\right)\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{5}{54}$.
