## Part A: Short-answer type questions

**For this part, answers must be written without any explanation.**


<ol>

<li>Find a non-constant polynomial that divides all the polynomials in the set:
\[ \mathcal{P} =  \{ P_k: P_k(x) = x^{3k+2}+x+1, k\in \mathbb{N} \}  \]
</li>




<li>Let \(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n\) denote the \(n\) roots of unity. Let \(\alpha_1=1\). What is the value of the following product?

\[ \prod_{i=2}^n (1-\alpha_i) \]

</li>

<li>We have a regular hexagon whose area is 1 sq.unit. A triangle is formed by joining the midpoints of alternate sides as shown below. What is the
area of the triangle?

</li>


<li>Let \( \displaystyle f(x) = \frac{x^2e^{x^2}}{1-x^2} \). Find the \(6\)th derivative of \(f\) evaluated at 0, that is, \(f^6(0)\). </li>


<li>The number of real valued solutions to the equation \(e^x=\sin x\) is:
<ol>
<li>0</li>
<li>1</li>
<li>2</li>
<li>4</li>
<li>none of the above.</li>
</ol>
</li>


<li>
Find a line \(l\) that intersects the four lines given below. The lines are in \(\mathbb{R}^3\). Express
the equation of \(l\) in the parameterized form as given for \(l_i\)s.
<br>

\begin{align*}
l_1: &\; (1,0,0) + t(0,0,1) \\
l_2: &\; (0,1,0) + t(1,0,0) \\
l_3: &\; (0,0,1) + t(0,1,0) \\

\end{align*}


</li>


<li>

<li>The sequence \(\sum_1^\infty |a_i-b_i|^{3/2} \) converges. </li>
<li>The sequence \(\sum_1^\infty (a_i-b_i)^2 \) converges. </li>
<li>The sequence \(\sum_1^\infty (a_i-b_i)^3 \) converges. </li>
</ol>
</li>


<li>
<p>
Let \(\phi(n)\) denote the number of positive integers less than \(n\) that are relatively prime to \(n\).
In other words, \(\phi(n)\) counts all \(m\) such that
\(\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1\).


</p>


<p>
The number \(n=220358\) is a product of three primes \(p\), \(q\) and \(r\).
We also know that \(\phi(n) = 109480.\)
</p>

<p>
Find the values of \(p\), \(q\) and \(r\).

<li>
<p>Calculate the determinant of the matrix given below:

\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6\\
2 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6\\
3 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6\\
4 & 4 & 4 & 4 & 5 & 6\\
5 & 5 & 5 & 5 & 5 & 6\\
6 & 6 & 6 & 6 & 6 & 6\\
\end{bmatrix}
</p>

</li>


<li>
<p>
Suppose \( S=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\} \).  Find the number of pairs \( (A,B) \)
that can be formed such that \(A \subseteq S\) and \(B\subset A\).
</p>
</li>

## Part B: Subjective questions

**Clearly explain your entire reasoning.** No credit will be given without reasoning. Partial solutions may get partial credit.

<p>
<b>B1.</b> Let \( p(x)=a_{0}+a_{1} x+a_{2} x^{2}+a_{3} x^{3}\) be a polynomial with integer coefficients
such that \(a_{0}\) and \(a_{3}\) are odd numbers.

<ol>
<li>Suppose \(p\) has a rational root \(\frac{p}{q}\), where \(\text{gcd}(p,q)=1\). Prove that both \(p\) and \(q\) must be odd.</li>
<li>Suppose \(a_0,a_3\) and \(a_0+a_1+a_2+a_3\) are all odd. Prove that \(f\) has no rational roots.</li>
</ol>

</p>

<p>
<b>B2. </b> By induction or otherwise, show that:

\[ \binom{n}{2} ! >\; 2^{n^2} \]

for all \(n\geq 6\).
</p>

<p>
<b>B3.</b> We are given two positive integers \(a>2\) and \(n\) such that the following \(n+1\) numbers
are all composite numbers:

\[ a,a+1,a+2,\ldots,a+n \]

Prove that there exists an integer \(t>1\) such that the following consecutive numbers are all composite:

\[ a^t,a^t+1,a^t+2,\ldots,a^t+n \]

</p>

<p>
<b>B4.</b> Consider the trapezoid \(ABCD\) in which \(|AD|=|BC|\). Prove that the centroid of the triangle \(ABD\) lies on the line \(CF\). Here,
point \(F\) is the projection of \(D\) on \(AB\).

</p>

<p>
<b>B5. </b> Let \(\pi\) denote a permutation of numbers from \(1\) to \(12\). We denote
the number at the \(i\)th position by \(\pi(i)\).
For example, if the permutation is \([1,12,11,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]\), then \(\pi(1) = 1\), \(\pi(2)=12\), \(\pi(3)=11\), etc.

Count the number of permutations \(\pi\) that satisfy the following condition:

\[ \pi(i) < \pi(i+1) \;\;\text{for } i \in \{1,2,4,5,7,8,9,11\} \]

Write your answer as a single number (without any factorials or binomials).


</p>

<p>
<b>B6. </b> We have a function \(f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\) that is twice differentiable and satisfies the following equation:

\[  \int_{x-y}^{x+y} f(t) dt  = 2yf(x)  \]

Prove that \(f(x)=ax+b\) for some \(a,b\in\mathbb{R}\).
