## Part A: Short-answer type questions

<ol>


<li><p>
Which of the following statements is true?<br>
(a) If a polygon inscribed in a circle has equal sides then it has equal angles.<br>
(b) If a polygon inscribed in a circle has equal angles then it has equal sides.<br>
(c) If a polygon has an inscribed circle, i.e. all its sides are tangent to the circle, and its sides are equal, then its angles are also equal.<br>
</p>
</li>


<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
(a) True. Suppose A, B and C are consecutive vertices of the polygon. Let O be the center. Then triangles OAB and OBC are congruent and isoceles. Hence, \( 1/2 \angle A = 1/2 \angle B\). Extend the argument to other vertices.<br>
(b) False. A wide rectangle can be inscribed in a circle. <br>
(c) False. A circle can be inscribed in a non-square rhombus.

<p><b>B1.</b> A regional math competition saw a participation from 200 students. The paper had 6 problems. We know that each problem
was correctly solved by at least 120 students. Prove that there must be two students such that every problem was solved by at least one
of these two students.
</p>

<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
We describe a way to find two such students. 200 students have turned in 720 solutions, so a student has solved 3.6 problems on an average. This means that there must be some student who
has solved at least four problems. Call this student A. Let us suppose A has not solved problems \(i\) and \(j\).<br>
At most 80 students have not solved \(i\) and at most 80 students have not solved \(j\).  So, we should be able to find at least 200-80-80=40 students
who have solved both the problems. Pick one such student along with student A to get the required pair.

<p><b>B2.</b> An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangle faces.  See the picture below. 
Each side of the icosahedron is 1 cm in length.  What is the length of the longest line segment that can be contained inside an icosahedron?
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<br><img src="/assets/images/002_22_b2_icosahedron.png"/>
</p>



<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
Note that opposite vertices of the icosahedron can be seen as vertices of pyramids whose bases are regular pentagons of side length 1. Now, note that if we select two parallel diagonals of these two pentagons, these two diagonals are also two sides of a rectangle whose other sides are length 1 and whose diagonals are diameters of the icosahedron. The diagonal of the pentagon can be found with similar triangles: in regular pentagon \(A B C D E\), let \(A D\) and \(B E\) intersect at \(F\). Angle chasing shows that \(\triangle A C D \sim \triangle D E F\), both are isosceles, and \(F E=F A\), so we get that \(\frac{A D}{1}=\frac{1}{A D-1} \Longrightarrow A D=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\). Hence, the diameter of the icosahedron equals \(\sqrt{1^{2}+\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{2}}=\frac{\sqrt{10+2 \sqrt{5}}}{2}\).<br>

<p><b>B3.</b> Prove the following inequality for all integers \(a,b\geq 2\):
\[
\frac{1}{\operatorname{gcd}(a, b-1)}+\frac{1}{\operatorname{gcd}(a-1, b)} \geq \frac{2}{\sqrt{a+b-1}}
\]
</p>


<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
Note that both \(\operatorname{gcd}(a, b-1)\) and \(\operatorname{gcd}(a-1, b)\) divide \(a+b-1\). Also they are relatively prime, since \(\operatorname{gcd}(a, b-1) \mid a\) and \(\operatorname{gcd}(a-1, b) \mid a-1\). So their product is less than or equal to \(a+b-1\), and therefore by the AM-GM inequality we have
\[
\frac{1}{\operatorname{gcd}(a, b-1)}+\frac{1}{\operatorname{gcd}(a-1, b)} \geq 2 \sqrt{\frac{1}{\operatorname{gcd}(a, b-1) \cdot \operatorname{gcd}(a-1, b)}} \geq \frac{2}{\sqrt{a+b-1}}
\]

<p><b>B4. (a)</b>
In \(\triangle A B C\), the altitude to \(\overline{A B}\) from \(C\) partitions \(\triangle A B C\) into two smaller triangles, each of which is similar to \(\triangle A B C\). If the side lengths of \(\triangle A B C\) and of both smaller triangles are all integers, find the smallest possible value of \(A B\).
</p>


<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
First, notice that length \(A E\) is completely determined by the fact that \(A B=B E\) and by the lengths of \(A B, B C\) and \(E C\). Thus, we only consider the triangle \(A B C\). First, drop altitude \(B H\) and note that since \(A B E\) is isoceles, \(E H=\frac{1}{2} A E\). Now, using Pythagoras twice, we have
\begin{align*}
&B H^{2}=5^{2}-E H^{2} \\
&B H^{2}=11^{2}-(7+E H)^{2} .
\end{align*}
Setting these two equations to be equal, we can thus solve the equation \(25=72-14 E H\). Therefore, \(A E=2 E H=\frac{47}{7}\).
</details>


<p><b>B4. (b)</b>
In quadrilateral \(A B C D\), diagonals \(A C\) and \(B D\) intersect at \(E\). If \(A B=B E=5, E C=C D=7\), and \(B C=11\), compute \(A E\).
</p>



<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
Let the altitude from \(C\) to \(A B\) intersect \(\overline{A B}\) at \(D\). Note that \(\angle A\) and \(\angle B\) must be acute since \(A D\) partitions \(A B C\) into two triangles. Since triangles \(A D C\) and \(A D B\) each contain right angles, we conclude that \(\angle A C B\) must be right.
Now, we must have \(\triangle A B C \sim \triangle A C D \sim \triangle C B D\). We now have enough information to determine \(A D, A B\), and \(C D\) in terms of \(A B, B C\), and \(C A\), which we denote as \(c\), \(a\), and \(b\), respectively. We have

\begin{align*}
&\frac{b}{A D}=\frac{c}{b} \Longrightarrow A D=\frac{b^{2}}{c} \\
&\frac{a}{B D}=\frac{c}{a} \Longrightarrow B D=\frac{a^{2}}{c} \\
&\frac{1}{2} C D \cdot c=\frac{1}{2} a b \Longrightarrow C D=\frac{a b}{c}
\end{align*}

Obviously, \((a, b, c)\) has to be in the form \((k x, k y, k z)\) where \((x, y, z)\) is a Pythagorean triple with no common factors, and \(k\) is a positive integer. Note that in particular \(x, y\), and \(z\) must be pairwise coprime, because of the constraint \(x^{2}+y^{2}=z^{2}\).
Given this, we need to find \(k\) such that

\[
k z\left|k^{2} y^{2} \Longleftrightarrow z\right| k y^{2} \Longleftrightarrow z \mid k,
\]

so the smallest such \(k\) is when \(k=z\). This choice makes \(B D\) and \(C D\) integral as well, so given any Pythagorean triple \((x, y, z)\) with pairwise coprime entries, the minimum \(k\) required equals \(z\), and the minimum possible value of \(c\) is \(z^{2}\). The smallest such Pythagorean triple is \((3,4,5)\), so report 25.

<p><b>B5.</b> Prove that among any six consecutive positive integers, we can always find a number that is relatively prime to the other five numbers.
</p>


<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
The 6 integers must all have different remainders when divided by 6. The two that have remainders 1 and 5 must have a difference of either 4 or 2 , so that any common divisor of these two integers must divide 2. As, however, the two integers are odd this shows that their \(gcd=1\). Neither of them can be divisible by 3 ; if one of them is divisible by 5 the other isn't. So the one not divisible by 5 is not divisible by any integer less than 7 (except 1). 
As its "distance" from any of the other 5 is less than 7, the result follows.<br>

<p><b>B6.</b> Show that the following integral converges:
\[  \lim_{B \rightarrow \infty} \int_{0}^{B} \frac{\cos (x)}{2x} \cos \left(x^{2}\right) dx \]
</p>



<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
We use integration by parts:
\begin{align*}
\int_{0}^{B} \sin x \sin x^{2} d x &=\int_{0}^{B} \frac{\sin x}{2 x} \sin x^{2}(2 x d x) \\
&=-\left.\frac{\sin x}{2 x} \cos x^{2}\right|_{0} ^{B} \\
&+\int_{0}^{B}\left(\frac{\cos x}{2 x}-\frac{\sin x}{2 x^{2}}\right) \cos x^{2} d x
\end{align*}

Now \(\frac{\sin x}{2 x} \cos x^{2}\) tends to 0 as \(B \rightarrow \infty\), and the integral of \(\frac{\sin x}{2 x^{2}} \cos x^{2}\) converges absolutely by comparison with \(1 / x^{2}\). Thus it suffices to note that

\begin{align*}
\int_{0}^{B} \frac{\cos x}{2 x} \cos x^{2} d x &=\frac{\cos x}{4 x^{2}} \cos x^{2}(2 x d x) \\
&=\left.\frac{\cos x}{4 x^{2}} \sin x^{2}\right|_{0} ^{B} \\
&-\int_{0}^{B} \frac{2 x \cos x-\sin x}{4 x^{3}} \sin x^{2} d x
\end{align*}

and that the final integral converges absolutely by comparison to \(1 / x^{3}\).
